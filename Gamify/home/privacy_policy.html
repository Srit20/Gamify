	<h2>What is a Privacy Policy ?</h2><p style="font-size: 20px;">
	A Privacy Policy is a legal statement that specifies what the business owner does with the 
	personal data collected from users, along with how the data is processed and for what 
	purposes.

	In 1968, Council of Europe did studies on the threat of the Internet expansion as they were 
	concerned with the effects of technology on human rights. This lead to the development of 
	policies that were to be developed to protect personal data.

	This marks the start of what we know now as a "Privacy Policy." While the name 
	"Privacy Policy" refers to the legal agreement, the concept of privacy and protecting 
	user data is closely related.

	This agreement can also be known under these names:

	* Privacy Statement
	* Privacy Notice
	* Privacy Information
	* Privacy Page

	A Privacy Policy can be used for both your website and mobile app if it's adapted to include 
	the platforms your business operates on.

	There are two main reasons why you need a Privacy Policy:

	✓ They're legally required: Privacy Policies are legally required by global privacy laws if 
	  you collect or use personal information.
	✓ Consumers expect to see them: Place your Privacy Policy link in your website footer, and 
	  anywhere else where you request personal information.


	However, most privacy laws identify the following critical points that a business must comply 
	with when dealing with personal data:

	Notice - Data collectors must clearly disclose what they are doing with the personal information 
			 from users before collecting it.
	Choice - The companies collecting the data must respect the choices of users on what information 
			 they choose to provide.
	Access - Users should be able to view, update or request the removal of personal data collected 
	         by the company.
	Security - Companies are entirely responsible for the accuracy and security (keeping it properly
	   		   away from unauthorized eyes and hands) of the collected personal information.</p>
