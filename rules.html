	<h2>1. <u>Tic Tac Toe</u></h2>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 5%">
	You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? 
	That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that 
	Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!<br><br>

	Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what 
	the person playing against you might do next.

	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	<ol style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	<li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
	
	<li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks
	   in empty squares.</li>
	
	<li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
	
	<li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	
	 
	
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%"><u>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</u></h3><br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%"> 
	To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy 
	means figuring out what you need to do to win.<br><br>
	
	Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying 
	to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.<br><br>
	
	After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look 
	at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.<br><br>
	
	You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer 
	gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer 
	will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.<br><br>
	
	If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at 
	least you'll tie.<br><br>

	<h2>2. <u>Rock Paper Scissior</u></h2>

	<h3 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">Why is Rock Paper Scissors played?</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the world. Apart from being a game played 
	to pass time, the game is usually played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is similar in that
	way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing straws. There is no room for cheating or 
	for knowing what the other person is going to do so the results are usually very satisfying with no room for 
	fighting or error.</p>
	<img src="RPS.png" height="180"  alt="RPS image"  style="margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%; width: 20%;">
	<h3 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">What are the rules of RPS?</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
	The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
	<br><ul style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	<li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
	<li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
	<li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
	</ul></p>


	<h3 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">The Hand Signals</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	In order to ensure fair play, the game signals have been agreed upon to ensure the uniformity of delivery every single time. This ensures that there will be no room for error and these signals have been approved for all types of recreational and professional play.
	The proper opening move will impact the overall success of the game. This means that special attention should be given to the way you move your hand initially before you attempt to make any signal so that other players are not aware of your intention. When you succeed to do so, you ensure that other players will not be able to make a signal that beats yours, at least not on purpose.
	<h4 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%"><u>The Rock</u></h4>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	The rock is internationally recognized by a closed fist where the thumb is not concealed. It is also one of the most popular opening moves and this is why it is considered to be one of the most popular hand signals. Most players will view using the rock as an opening move to be somehow aggressive but would still use it because it is easy. The rock will beat scissors every time but will be beaten by paper.
	</p>
	<h4 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%"><u>The Paper</u></h4>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	Paper is delivered in the same way as the rock except that in this case all the fingers and the thumb are extended in a way that they all face the same direction. The vertical paper or the handshake is strictly forbidden in tournaments of Rock Paper Scissors because it might resemble the scissors which can lead to unnecessary confusion. Paper is one of the most challenging opening moves because there is no indication of what you intend to do next. As a result, many players will be concerned when you use it as an opening move to your game. Paper will beat rock but will be beaten by scissors in no time.
	</p>
	<h4 style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%"><u>The Sciccor</u></h4>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
	Scissors are thrown in the same way as rock where the hand is clenched into a fist but the index and the middle finger are extended to the front in order to make an angle that is of 30 to 45 degrees in a way that would resemble a pair of scissors. The use of horizontal scissors is strictly forbidden in tournaments because they can resemble the shape of paper. Opening with scissors is not a very smart move because your opponent will be able to guess what your signal is going to be easily and so will be able to come up with a stronger signal.
	
	<br><br>It is very important to conceal your move and to surprise your opponent if you want to make sure that you will win this game.
	</p>

	<h2>3. <u>Snake Game</u></h2>
	<img src="snake2.png" style="margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%; width: 20%;">
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 5%">
	The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail, other obstacle, or itself.<br><br>
	
	The Snake concept comes in two major variants:
	<ol style="font-size: 20px;  margin-left: 5%">
		<li>	In the first, which is most often a two-player game, there are multiple snakes on the playfield. Each player attempts to block the other so the opponent runs into an existing trail and loses. Surround for the Atari VCS is an example of this type. The Light Cycles segment of the Tron arcade game is a single-player version where the other "snakes" are AI controlled.</li>
		<li>	In the second variant, a sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult. Examples: Nibbler, Snake Byte.</li>
	</ol>
