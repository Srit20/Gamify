<h2>What are Website Terms and Conditions?</h2>
Terms and conditions are a binding set of rules that serve as a contract between you and the users who visit your website or use your app.

They are also known as terms of service and terms of use, and are abbreviated as T&Cs (or ToS and ToU, respectively).

Having terms and conditions isn’t a legal requirement, but they are critical to maintaining your rights and protecting your business. Therefore, it’s in your best interest to create a terms and conditions template for your services, and display the agreement on your site.




<h2>What is a Terms and Conditions Agreement?</h2>
A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administrator’s rules regarding user behavior, and provides information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform.<br><br>

Your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look to this agreement to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Creating the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business from the following:
<ul>
<li>Abusive users : Terms and conditions allow you to establish what constitutes appropriate activity on your site or app, so you can remove abusive users and content that violates your guidelines.</li>

<li>Intellectual property theft : Asserting your claim to the creative assets of your site in your terms and conditions will prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement.</li>

<li>Potential litigation : If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.</li>
</ul>
In short, terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal reinforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.

<h2>Do Websites Need Terms and Conditions?</h2>
Terms and conditions are not required by law, but are extremely important to the long-term success and viability of your website.<br>

Having website terms and conditions is considered standard business practice in the US, Canada, the UK, and just about everywhere else — from South Africa to Australia.<br><br>
If you plan to grow your business or expand your user base, a simple terms and conditions agreement will provide your website with an additional layer of legal protection, and allow you to maintain your rights.<br><br>


<h2>What Should I Include in a Standard Terms and Conditions?</h2>
Even a short terms and conditions agreement should include several key clauses to safeguard your business. For example, if you’re selling online and incorrectly price an item, your terms and conditions are what will enable you to cancel the order.<br><br>

The following are some of the most important sections of your terms and conditions for ensuring user clarity and preventing misunderstandings:
<ul>
<li><b>Disclaimer</b><br>
A disclaimer states that your site is available on an “as-is and as-available basis,” and that users use it at their own risk. A basic disclaimer template should include these terms are others, as well.</li>

<li><b>Corrections</b><br>
We’re all human. If you make errors on your site, you need to show that you’re not liable. This section covers your back just in case there are any mistakes in your content, allowing you to update it with the correct information at any time.<br>

Terms and Conditions Corrections Section</li>

<li><b>Term and Terminations</b><br>
Particularly useful if you offer software as a service (SaaS) applications, this section protects you from abusive users by giving you the right to suspend user accounts and delete any content they post.</li>

<li><b>Prohibited Activities</b><br>
Explicitly listing prohibited activities is another way to stop visitors misusing your site. This section should include a special clause regarding user-generated content in forums and comments. For example, to help you remove offensive usernames.</li>

<li><b>Modifications and Interruptions</b><br>
By reserving the right to change or delete anything on your site, as well as stating that you may encounter hardware problems and downtime, you limit your liability if users claim any loss or damage because of an inability to access your site.</li>

Modifications and Interruptions in a Website Terms and Conditions

<li><b>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice and Policy</b><br>
Terms and conditions also explain the rules the website administrator will abide by. This section specifies that you will remove any material that infringes users’ copyright according to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</li>

<li><b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
To comply with international privacy laws and avoid being fined, your site needs a privacy policy. It must be a separate document, but you can include a link in this section of your terms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
